# Physics-assisted Deep Probability Learning approach of Natural Gas leaks detection (PhyDPPL_NGleaks)
This repository contains keras implementations of  variational Bayesian spatial-temporal neural network, physics-assisted one class probabilistic neural network and related evluation programs for detection of natural gas leakage from oil&gas facilities.

## Requirments
* tensorflow-gpu=1.14.0
* wheel=0.37.1
* scikit-learn=0.24.2
* python=3.6.13
* numpy=1.19.2
* matplotlib=3.2.0
* keras=2.2.5
* h5py=2.10.0
* opencv-python=4.4.0.46

```Bash
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
``` 

## Sample usage
* Download thermal images of outdoor site from the script <https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KoFAmjz6vlAq2cIhuRS08Q?pwd=y2nb> with code `y2nb`. With them, the Variational Bayesian Spatial-Temporal neural network model could be developed by running `python vbstnn_shiwai.py`.
* Download thermal images of indoor site from the script <https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jzCLp4Ww415QMVsEgICdbg?pwd=q6qy> with code `q6qy`. With them, the Variational Bayesian Spatial-Temporal neural network model could be developed by running `python vbstnn_shinei.py`.
